Developed an AI-powered program to solve the Mini-SHRDLU game, a block-moving puzzle inspired by Terry Winograd's software from MIT AI Laboratory. Implemented efficient algorithms and data structures in C++ to automatically generate solutions for the game. Utilized game tree search and goal evaluation techniques to guide the movement of numbered blocks on a vertically suspended board. Successfully solved the game by finding optimal sequences of actions, showcasing expertise in AI algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving.
